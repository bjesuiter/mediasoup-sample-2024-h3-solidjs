## Tab to Tab Test

1. Have a Loopback passthrough device (in my case: "Hijack Audio")
2. Go to the tag from 2025-02-08
3. Run bun dev in /packages/client
4. Run bun dev in /packages/server
5. Set the default input to "Hijack Audio" (to avoid isses in audio device selection)
6. Open http://localhost:8000 for the client
7. Send and receive audio via the trpc pages
